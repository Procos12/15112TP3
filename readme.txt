Project Description:
This project is based on a game called Pikmin by Nintendo. I felt inspired by the interactions in the game and thought to myself that I could make such a game in 2 dimensions, from a top down perspective. The main point of Pikmin is to explore the world and survive day by day by collecting resources. This project is kind of like a tech demo for what could be added on in the future by building on the code here. 
In sum there will be a main character, pikmin which are small creatures that serve the player, enemies, fruit, and a spaceship.
In this project, I will implement the advanced interactions between the pikmin and the world around them, with the player as the commander. Pikmin are able to follow the main character, attack enemies, and bring back items to the spaceship. Enemies are also able to attack pikmin, so pikmin are able to die as well. If an enemy is brought to the ship it will spawn more pikmin to allow the player to do activities faster. If a fruit is brought to the ship it will be stored as treasure.
Dependencies:
The only outside library that is used it pygame 
it can be installed using pip:
pip3 install pygame
Main file:
The project file is PikminMini.py
